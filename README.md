## Module to show when other development modules are active

This is a module that will expose a block showing whether the following modules devel, coder, devel_themer are active on your site. This gives an extra signal for you to disable them before you take your site live. Also, this module and its development is detailed in my blog post to show how to develop modules in drupal with TDD.
